# README for Static Book Manager

This library system helps you manages book collections by allowing you to add, remove, borrow, and track overdue
books using a Max Heap and an AVL Tree. To get started, make sure you have Python 3.x installed, open the code in PyCharm,
 and set up the Python interpreter. Once you run the application, you'll see a menu where you can manage books, borrow them,
 view overdue statuses, or exit. Just follow the prompts to add books with a title, author, and 4-digit ISBN,
 and easily keep track of your books
